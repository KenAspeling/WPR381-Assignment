To complete the project, you would need to add actual image files to the public/images directory.

For each event in your application, create an image file with the name matching the path in your events data:
- meetup.jpg
- workshop.jpg
- festival.jpg

Alternatively, you can create a single placeholder.jpg file to be used when an event image is not found.
